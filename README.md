Exploratory analysis of an NBA Player of the Week data set, supplemented by data from the NBA API was pursued to explore a hypothesis from Horace Grant that the league has tended toward “small ball” due to rule changes such as the addition of the three point shot and the elimination of forearm checking. Initial results, such as the average weight of an NBA player dropping 10lbs in the past 20 years and the average height of players taking 3pt shots increasing 2 inches, support this hypothesis. Additionally, NBA player and team data was evaluated to investigate how NBA Players of the Week affect overall team performance and even how they affect an individual game. The exploratory data analysis discussed in the report just breaks the surface on the NBA API dataset as shown by the variety of analyses performed. Non-exhaustive areas for future data exploration are included for consideration.
